Getting started
===============

The Symfony bridge is a bundle that you can use in any Symfony application.

.. code-block:: php

    $bundles[] = new Tolerance\Bridge\Symfony\Bundle\ToleranceBundle();

**Note**: you can also *manually* use the classes in the :code:`Tolerance\Bridge\Symfony` namespace if you do not want
to install this bundle in your Symfony application.
